The following sections provide more details about each of these charging methods.

== PAYGO

* Requires a subscription from a cloud provider's marketplace for pay-as-you-go pricing at an hourly rate.
* Offers Cloud Volumes ONTAP in three different licensing options: Explore, Standard, and Premium. Each license provides support for different amounts of storage and compute.
* A 30-day free trial is available for the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that you deploy in a cloud provider. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_evaluating.html[Learn more about 30-day free trials^].
** There are no hourly software charges, but cloud provider infrastructure charges still apply (compute, storage, and networking).
** When the free trial ends, you'll be charged hourly according to the selected license, as long as you subscribed. If you haven't subscribed, the system shuts down.
+
Cloud Manager prompts you to subscribe to your cloud provider's marketplace when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* Conversions to another licensing option isn't supported.
* Basic technical support is offered, but you must https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_registering.html[register and activate the NetApp serial number associated with your system^].

== Capacity-based licensing

Capacity-based licensing enables you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity, along with add-on cloud data services. The license is associated with your NetApp account and enables you to create as many Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems as you need, as long as enough capacity is available through your license. This licensing method is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 and later.

Cloud Manager aggregates the capacity of all data volumes for every Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in your NetApp account and charges based on the allocated capacity. Storage efficiency improves total cost of ownership (TCO) since less cloud resources are required, but it doesn't affect license calculations.

Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a _package_. When you deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can choose from the following packages: Freemium, Essential, and Professional.

NOTE: For each package (other than Freemium), there is a minimum allocated capacity charge of 4 TB. Any Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance that has less than 4 TB of allocated capacity will be charged at a rate of 4 TB.

Freemium package::

* Provides all Cloud Volumes ONTAP features free of charge from NetApp (cloud provider charges still apply).
* There is no time limit for the Freemium package.
* Support is not included.
* You're limited to 500 GB of allocated capacity per Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* You can use up to 10 Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems with the Freemium package per NetApp account.
* If the allocated capacity for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system exceeds 500 GB, Cloud Manager automatically converts the system to the Essential package and charging starts.
+
Any other systems that have less than 500 GB of allocated capacity stay on the Freemium package.

Essential package::

* Provides a la carte licensing for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:
** Cloud Volumes ONTAP single node or high availability with file storage, block storage, and/or secondary data (disaster recovery).
** Your choice of add-on NetApp Cloud Services like Cloud Backup, Cloud Data Sense, and more.
* This package is available as a license (BYOL) purchased from NetApp.
* Support is included for the length of the subscription term.
* Conversions to another licensing option isn't supported.
* Each individual Cloud Volumes ONTAP system supports up to 2 PB of capacity through disks and tiering to object storage.

https://cloud.netapp.com/ontap-cloud[View pricing details on Cloud Central^].

Professional package::

* Provides licensing for both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup Service at a lower price than purchasing them separately.
* This package is available as an annual contract from the AWS Marketplace or as a license (BYOL) purchased from NetApp.
+
If you have an AWS Marketplace contract, _all_ Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that you deploy are charged against that contract. You can't mix and match a Marketplace contract with BYOL.
* Support is included for the length of the subscription term.
* Conversions to another licensing option isn't supported.
* Each individual Cloud Volumes ONTAP system supports up to 2 PB of capacity through disks and tiering to object storage.

== Node-based licensing

* The previous generation BYOL for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* A node-based license is available for license renewals only.
* Each Cloud Volumes ONTAP system supports up to 368 TB of capacity per license.
* Conversions to another licensing option isn't supported.

If you want to transition to capacity-based licensing, you can purchase a license, deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and then replicate the data to that new system.
