Notes:

. The custom machine type has 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of memory. For details about standard machine types, refer to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#standard_machine_types[Google Cloud Documentation: Machine Types^].

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs.

. Disk limits prevent you from reaching the 368 TB capacity limit by using disks alone. You can reach the 368 TB capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^].

. For Google Cloud Platform region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.
