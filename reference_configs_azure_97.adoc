Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Azure as a single node system or an HA pair. Two pricing options are available: pay as you go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL).

== Pay-as-you-go overview

* Offers Cloud Volumes ONTAP in three different configurations: Explore, Standard, and Premium.
* A 30-day free trial is available for the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that you deploy in Azure.
+
There are no hourly software charges, but Azure infrastructure charges still apply (compute, storage, and networking).
* Conversions from PAYGO to BYOL aren't currently supported.
* Basic technical support is offered, but you must register and activate the NetApp serial number associated with your system.

== BYOL overview

* Single node or HA license with 12, 24, and 36-month subscription options.
* Support is included for the length of the subscription term.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Azure as a single-node system and as an HA pair.

=== Single node systems

You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single-node system in Azure:

Notes:

. These VM types are supported starting with 9.7 P5. The VMs use an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[Ultra SSD^] for VNVRAM, which provides better write performance.

. This VM type includes local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_enabling_flash_cache.html[Learn more].

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs, but not when using the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

. Data tiering is not supported with the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].
